# An Implementation of Stochastic and Deterministic Gradient Policy in Continuous Bandits Problem --- Prediction Markets
---
This is a program that simulates an agent who trades in a prediction market. The problem that the prediction market aims to solve is to predict the real distribution of a random variable. We define the random variable as the colour of a bucket. The problem design comes from a human-subjective experiment for decision markets.

In this program, we implement two agents. `StochasticGradientAgent` and `DeterministicGradientAgent`. The both classes are in the file `PolicyGradientAgent.py`. The algorithm of `StochasticGradientAgent` references the "_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd edition_" [1]. `DeterministicGradientAgent` is an implementation of "_Deterministic policy gradient algorithms_" [2].
